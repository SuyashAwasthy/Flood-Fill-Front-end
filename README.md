# Flood-Fill-Front-end
This is the front-end implementation of flood-fill project which was earlier developed in C++ using recursion and backtracking algorithm.
Here, I have used HTML, CSS and javascript to implement this project using BFS Algorithm.

User marks the starting cell, ending cell and some obstacles. Finally, on clicking the "Solve Maze" button, the path is shown in blue color and the neighbouring nodes are shown in yellow color.

It helps to visualize the BFS algorithm and helped me in learning front-end technologies better.
